                        Trafalgar D. Water Law, commonly known as Trafalgar Law,
                        is a major character in One Piece. He is the captain of
                        the Heart Pirates and a skilled doctor and swordsman.
                        Law possesses the Ope Ope no Mi, a powerful
                        Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to
                        create a "Room" where he can manipulate objects,
                        people, and even swap their body parts at will.
